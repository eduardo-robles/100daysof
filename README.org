   This is a collection of queries and rules used in Security Operations. I have compiled this list for my own personal use. Most of these are simply to experiment with writing scripts and code for security operations.

*** Prerequisites

- A text editor

You can use most of these tools on major platforms. Most SIEM platforms use Detection Rules that incoporate Sigma, Suricata, and some sort of log search which involves a variation of SQL.
